IN ORDER TO USE CODE CHANGE "FROM" AND "TO" TO THE COLOURS YOU WOULD LIKE THERE IS NOTES NEXT TO THE CODE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO HELP THE USER WORK IT.

For this project I decided to choose contract 4. This contract tasks me with creating a reskinning tool. In order to successfully complete this task I will need to make a program that will be able to successfully identify a colour and will then be able to change this colour to one of the user's choice. This program will be most useful for artists as if they wanted to modify one their art pieces and change a certain colour then they would be able to do it quickly and easily with a reskinning tool.

In order to prevent any issues with copyrights and ownership the image I used as an example was created by me.
