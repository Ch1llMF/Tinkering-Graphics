For this project I decided to choose contract 4. This contract tasks me with creating a reskinning tool. In order to successfully complete this task I will need to make a program that will be able to successfully identify a colour and will then be able to change this colour to one of the user's choice. This program will be most useful for artists as if they wanted to modify one their art pieces and change a certain colour then they would be able to do it quickly and easily with a reskinning tool.
